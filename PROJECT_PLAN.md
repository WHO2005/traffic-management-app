# Kigali Traffic Management System - Project Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for a comprehensive traffic management system specifically designed for Kigali, Rwanda. The system will leverage modern web technologies to provide real-time traffic information, route optimization, and traffic pattern analysis to help drivers navigate Kigali more efficiently.

## Project Goals
1. Create a "best of the best" traffic management system for Kigali
2. Provide real-time traffic information and route optimization
3. Help drivers find the best streets with less traffic based on their location and destinations
4. Support both desktop and mobile usage
5. Integrate with Kigali-specific traffic data and landmarks

## Key Features

### 1. Real-time Traffic Monitoring
- Live traffic data visualization
- Traffic density mapping
- Incident reporting system
- Traffic light status monitoring

### 2. Route Optimization
- Intelligent route planning based on current traffic conditions
- Multiple route options (fastest, shortest, eco-friendly)
- Real-time route adjustments
- Kigali-specific landmarks and points of interest

### 3. Traffic Analytics
- Traffic pattern analysis
- Peak hour identification
- Violation tracking and reporting
- Historical data analysis

### 4. User Features
- Driver location tracking
- Destination input with autocomplete for Kigali locations
- Route recommendations dashboard
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Responsive design for all devices
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Interactive maps using OpenStreetMap
- Modern UI/UX with animations and transitions

### Backend
- Python Flask framework
- Real-time data processing
- Database integration (MySQL/SQLite)
- RESTful API for data access
- WebSocket for real-time communication

### Data Sources
